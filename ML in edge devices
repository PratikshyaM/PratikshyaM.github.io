Machine Learning has gone from just training and deploying models in servers to being available for android devices(apps), 
IOT devices like Raspberry Pi and microcontrollers like Arduino. Tensorflow has opened ground for a lighter version to be used
in client side applications through javascript - Tensorflow Lite. A whole range of opportunities have opened up through this.
I am so eager to learn and explore it.
